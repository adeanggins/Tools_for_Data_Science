    "The organizational importance of Data Science is continuously increasing. According to one study, the global Data Science market is expected to grow to $115 billion by 2023. Some of the many Data Science benefits include the following:</br>\n",
    "- In the healthcare industry, physicians use Data Science to analyze data from wearable trackers to ensure their patientsâ€™ well-being and make vital decisions. Data Science also enables hospital managers to reduce waiting time and enhance care.\n",
    "- Retailers use Data Science to enhance customer experience and retention.\n",
    "- Data Science is widely used in the banking and finance sectors for fraud detection and personalized financial advice.\n",
    "- Transportation providers use Data Science to enhance the transportation journeys of their customers. For instance, Transport for London maps customer journeys offering personalized transportation details, and manages unexpected circumstances using statistical data.\n",
    "- Construction companies use Data Science for better decision making by tracking activities, including average time for completing tasks, materials-based expenses, and more.\n",
    "- Data Science enables trapping and analyzing massive data from manufacturing processes, which has gone untapped so far.\n",
    "- With Data Science, one can analyze massive graphical data, temporal data, and geospatial data to draw insights. It also helps in seismic interpretation and reservoir characterization.\n",
    "- Data Science facilitates firms to leverage social media content to obtain real-time media content usage patterns. This enables the firms to create target audience-specific content, measure content performance, and recommend on-demand content.\n",
    "- Data Science helps study utility consumption in the energy and utility domain. This study allows for better control of utility use and enhanced consumer feedback.\n",
    "- Data Science applications in the public service field include health-related research, financial market analysis, fraud detection, energy exploration, environmental protection, and more.\n",
